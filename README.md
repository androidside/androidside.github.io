I am a web developer with 10 ten years of experience in PHP.

One of which is in Laravel Framework specifically. I have a background in system development and can engage clients on all levels. Whether it is managing a team, meeting clients from around the world, or contributing to open source code libraries, I am a great addition to any project. I am an all round web developer. I have a good knowledge of front-end and back-end techniques.

I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. Also I like working in a team, you will learn faster and more. As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.
